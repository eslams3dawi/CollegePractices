# Microprocessor (Assembly Language)

This repository contains various assembly language programs designed to work with microprocessors. The focus is on understanding the core concepts of assembly language programming, interacting with hardware at a low level, and solving problems using assembly language.

## Topics Covered

- **Registers**: 
  - Understanding the different types of registers in a microprocessor (e.g., general-purpose registers, data registers, status registers, program counter, stack pointer, etc.).
  - How to manipulate and use registers for data storage, calculations, and control flow.

- **Loops**: 
  - Implementation of loops (e.g., `FOR`, `WHILE` loops) using assembly language constructs.
  - How to use jump instructions (`JMP`, `JE`) to control loop flow.

- **Arrays**:
  - Handling arrays in assembly, including initializing and accessing array elements.
  - Using registers and memory addressing to work with arrays efficiently.

- **Jump Instructions**: 
  - How to use jump instructions to alter the flow of execution
  - Conditional and unconditional jumps to implement decision-making in programs.

- **Stack Operations**:
  - Working with the stack, including pushing and popping data.
  - Understanding the stack pointer and its role in function calls and recursion.

## Contents

- **Model Assembly Code**: Includes multiple assembly language models for understanding basic concepts and logic implementations.
  - `Assembly model 1.asm`
  - `Assembly model 2.asm`
  - `Assembly model 3.asm`
  - etc.

- **Lab Exercises**: These are hands-on exercises meant to help students understand the application of assembly language in real-world scenarios.
  - `LAB1 Q1.asm`
  - `LAB1 Q2.asm`
  - etc.

## Purpose

This project is aimed at helping students and developers familiarize themselves with microprocessor architecture, instruction sets, and low-level programming. Itâ€™s intended for anyone learning assembly language or working with microprocessor-based systems.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of microprocessors and computer architecture.
- Familiarity with assembly language syntax.
- An emulator or actual microprocessor hardware to run assembly programs.

## Usage

To run the assembly programs, you will need an assembler and an emulator that supports the specific microprocessor model. Follow the instructions for your environment to compile and run the `.asm` files.
